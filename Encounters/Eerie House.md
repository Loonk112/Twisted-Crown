# Abstract
As the heroes travel and the sun sets, it is time to set camp.

Luckily they come across a homestead, but strangely, despite warm fire and almost ready food, no residents can be found. More over, no animals are to be fund either, despite a dog house and stables outside. Not even bugs, normally flying around at this hour.
# Outside
**Time**: Evening.
**Sounds**: No sound.
**Lighting**: Dim light from the homestead's windows.
**Ground**: Grass.

The homestead is surrounded by a stone, knee-high (human) wall.

Within the wall, marking the perimeter, at the center stands a wooden house, about two floors high, ground floor included with it's front door cracked open.

Connected to the side of the house is a small dog house, about a meter high.

On the opposite side, about 2 meters away from the house stands a small stable.

An additional door can be seen on the stable-side wall of the house.
## Dog house
Small dog house, about a meter high, it's walls and roof connected directly to the house.
Inside, to the side of the hole, a small wooden bowl filled with water is placed on the wooden floor, covered with small amounts of shed fur.
## Stables
Small, wooden stables with closed, wooden doors.
Inside the structure, two feeders are placed along the walls, filled with grass and water respectively.
The ground is covered with straw, and on one wall, two horse harnesses are hung, along with some horseshoes and brushed.
# House
**Sounds**: Crackling fire in the hearth.
**Smells**: Warm stew.
**Lighting**: Unless specified otherwise, rooms are lit with Everlight Crystals, mounted on the ceilings, with leather hoods, held open above to allow cover.
**6th sense**: Any beings with connection to Occult or Divine feel restless while inside the house.
## Entryway
The entryway is 15ft by 10ft, with about 5 pairs shoes placed about and coats hanged on nails driven into the walls at an angle.

To the right of the entry, leaning against the wall stands a shovel.

To the left is a doorway, leading into a small corridor, which opens into the dining room from the end of it's long side.
### Shoes
Of five pairs, two are child sized and three adult sized by human standard.
Of the adult pairs, one is dirty with mud.
### Coats
About six coats of various sizes are hanged on the wall, showing various states of wear and tear.
### Shovel
Simple wooden shovel. Two leather gloves hang on it's handle.
Closer investigation shows mud, still wet on the blade.
## Dining room
The room is about 20 ft. by 35 ft.
Entering the dining room, first thing that can be seen is a long, wooden table set with dishes, mostly bowls as well as an old, rusty case that is covered in dirt.

At the far end of the room, a hearth is placed with two armchairs standing in front of it.

On two sides of the hearth are passageways into the kitchen.
To the right of the hearth is another doorway with it's door held open by a wooden stopper, revealing stairway up.
### Table
The table is set with bowls and cutlery, as well as a bowl of apples.
At the end of the table that points towards the hearth, an old, rusty, metal case stands, with a hammer and a chisel placed beside it.
#### Case
Old, rust and dirty with mud, the case is about 30 cm by 20 cm at the base, about 10 cm high.
The locking mechanism is visibly broken by the pick.

Opening the case reveals it's empty insides.
### Hearth
The hearth is about 10 ft. wide, with fire cheerfully burning inside, on the wood.

In front of it stand two armchairs, worn with time, but of quite a good quality.
On the ground in front of one of the armchairs lies a single, word yellow book and beside it an apple.
#### Book
The book is yellow and visibly worn with time.

Opening the book, the inner title page says "The King In Yellow".

Any character attempting to read further, will be seemingly unable to turn pages, as they need to succeed on High Will Save to do so.
*Critical Success*: The character opens the book normally
*Success*: As above, but they also gain Frightened 1 condition
*Failure*: Character gains Frightened 2 condition
*Critical Failure*: As above, but the character also gains Fleeing condition
The above conditions last as long at the book is visible (or otherwise perceived) by the character.

Opening the book, beyond the first page, reveals slightly yellowed paged, empty of any writing.
GM may instead place a strange, otherworldly play. I did not do so, as it is implied to have consequences if read, but I have no idea how to implement any.

Probably unknown to the party, the book is #1 among the restricted books, as per *NPC Core*.
#### Apple
The apple on the floor was bit into, it's flesh still white.
## Kitchen
Kitchen is about 20 ft. by 15 ft. with door leading outside on the far end.

In the middle of the kitchen, connected to the other side of the hearth is a cooking pit, filled with hot charcoal, properly raked so as to put it out. On it, filled with warm stew is an iron pot.

On the outer wall of the kitchen are cupboards and drawers, with remainders of ingredients used in the stew piled in a small wooden box on one such counter.

A wooden ladle lies on the floor, with some stew staining it and the floor.
## Second floor
Second floor, upon reaching the landing shows a narrow corridor with three sets of doors, leading into master bedroom, child bedroom and a storage room respectively.
### Master Bedroom

The chest, if opened is shown to contain a pouch with 5 d10 gold pieces and a ledger of business, with it's last entry today at noon.
Last entry mentions buying wheat and meat for horses and family.
### Child room

Inside are three beds, one adult sized and two child sized - all unmade.
The room is filled with scattered toys: dolls, wooden horses and even wooden swords.

At the foot of each bed are small chest, filled with clothes and some miscellaneous items, such as rocks or wreaths made of straw.
