An old mercantile organisation.

# Hierarchy
Despite the name, House Vandyrre is not a familiar organisation.
It is a collective of merchants across the continent, who all agree to share profits with one another and protect each other's assets.

## Vandyrre
The name Vandyrre is not one inherited through blood, but one gained through influence.
There is a single Vandyrre for each country, serving as a spokes-person for the House.

In order to elect a Vandyrre, each member of the house, based within said kingdom gathers and then vote on who is to be the new Vandyrre.

A Vandyrre can be re-elected if one of the following happens:
- A vote of confidence rules the current Vandyrre unfit
- Vandyrre dies or is otherwise unreachable for at least a year
- Vandyrre is determined to have intentionally acted against the interests of the House
