# Origin
Founded in 4712, it is one of the bigger underground organisations in [[Warthan Kingdom]], whose hideouts are placed in high-class courtesan houses across major settlements, with smaller units, working as traveling bawd groups.

Spread across all holds, it primarily serves as an information guild and black market venues. Notably, few clients know that the establishments they use belong to an organisation, as they take great care to hide any connections - both to the clients and to their other cells. In fact, it is not rare for their operatives to be unaware of not only the size of the organisation, but even the name.
# Hierarchy
While unknown to the bottom rungs, the guild's leadership consists of three individuals:
- ## Handle
Current: [[Besh Rathkuth]]
Handle acts as the primary sponsor, one who supplies the funds where needed.
- ## Cage
Current: [[Kautt Rennorn]]
Cage acts as manager, who ensures smooth day-to-day operations, by deciding where to set up new branches and solves any issues that arise.
- ## Light
Current: #TODO 
Light acts as the spotlight, who filters and works with gathered information, ensuring all important news are quickly noticed and dealt with.

## General members
Each of these three have a separate groups under them, who might not be aware who is above them, but also unaware what position exactly are their coworkers and if they even are part of the organisations.

## Decisions
If any important issues come up, the three parts of the lantern meet in disguises and discuss them.
