# Abstract
Twisted from the centuries spent in Dark Tapestry, [[Leorick]] changed, gaining favor of outer gods and great old ones.
Standing at 1.76m, Leorick is lean, elegantly dressed man, with shortly cut brown hair and green eye. When looking closely, one can see something undulating underneath his skin, akin to tentacles.
His right eye is gone, replaced by a tentacle with eyes, approximately 10 feet in length that is black-gray in color and ending in a foot long black spike.
On top of his head lies a single, rusted crown.
