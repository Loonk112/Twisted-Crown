# Synopsis
Ancient tyrant, thought to have been killed returns from exile. Twisted over the years, he is but a shell of what once was. A shell that contains madness and illogic.

Strike down the monster before it is too late...

# One-Shot
Players are controlling a pre-generated characters based on those from Begginer Box - new guards who serve as a patrol for the ongoing festival.

## Introduction
The festival celebrates the rebirth of the [[Warthan Kingdom]], from the hands of a [[Leorick|Mad Tyrant]], who's name was long forgotten over the last 500 years.

It is currently a second day of the festival, and you have heard from your co-worker's that they encountered more issue's then the last years the festival was held.

## Day Two

As the player's patrol the festival grounds, they see countless people enjoying the festival.

Perception: DC #TODO
- Critical Success
As with success, but you also can her him whispering: 'He's coming onto the world. The wound will wash it clean.', over and over.
- Success
You notice a man, standing unsteadily next to a wall, muttering something. He is un-reactive, even as some of the people accidentally bump into him.
- Failure
You see a man who's standing next to a wall.
- Critical Failure
You see nothing special in the crowd of the festival goers
---
The man is unresponsive, no matter what the player's do. Looking into his eyes, players can notice that his irises are diluted and unfocused. On a DC #TODO Nature Recall Knowledge, you can notice the following: It does not seem to be an influence of a drug or anything else you know of.

If players turn him in to either the guard or the hospital, he will be moved normally.
If reported to higher ups about the muttering, player's will learn that the man is not the first to be found in such a state. He will, furthermore add that he suspects that it's either some sort of a new drug or maybe even just a strange string of madness, caused by the festival goers being overwhelmed.
