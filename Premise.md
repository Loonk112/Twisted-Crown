The man is unresponsive, no matter what the player's do. Looking into his eyes, players can notice that his irises are dilluted and unfocused. On a DC 10 Nature Recall Knowledge, you can notice the following: It does not seem to be an influence of a drug or anything else you know of.

If players turn him in to either the guard or the hospital, he will be moved normally.
If reported to higher ups about the muttering, player's will learn that the man is not the first to be found in such a state. He will, furthermore add that he suspects that it's either some sort of a new drug or maybe even just a strange string of madness, caused by the festival goers being overwhelmed.
