Placed at the south-west border of the Warthan kingdom, the hold borders the [[Burning Plains]] in the north-west, and [[Dragon Tail]] mountains in the south-west, with access to the [[Ascended Ocean]] from south to east.
The land of the Olviette can be split in two halves - Northern that is a mix of swamp and marsh and Southern - mostly mountainous, with some grasslands along the coast.
