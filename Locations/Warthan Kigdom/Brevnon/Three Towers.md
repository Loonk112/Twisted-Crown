**Class**: Landmark
**Location**: Southern [[Warthan Kingdom]], South-East [[Brevnon]]
# Geography
Placed in the hills of south-eastern Brevnon, Three Towers are named such after the ruins of three separate towers, each built on a different hilltop.

# History
Built in eons past, before the Warthan kingdom was first founded, the towers were built for and by Aeons.
Now, long since broken, the towers stand with barely a fraction of their power and the truth of their origin long forgotten.
Despite that, the location is till often visited, especially by the pilgrim monks who seek balance.
It is also said that no Outsider may step within the borders of the Three Towers.
