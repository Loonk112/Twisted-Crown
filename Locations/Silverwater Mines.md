# Overview
**Class**: Resource, Landmark
**Location**: North of [[Silverwater]], in [[Harfeld]], [[Warthan Kingdom]]

# Geography
Placed in [[Lazarus' Spine]] mountains, there are multiple entrances spread about the mountain side and the tunnels inside are not only vast, but also interconnected.
# History
Built early in the kingdom's history, the mine served as major supply of precious metals, such as silver and - at one point, dawnsilver.
Later on, when the dawnsilver supply was expanded, the mines got overrun by monsters, halting any excavation.
