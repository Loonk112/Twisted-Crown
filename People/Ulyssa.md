# Beggings
Ulyssa was born as the only princess of [[Warthan Kingdom]], she was also the youngest of the three siblings, being born 5 years after [[Leorick]] and 7 after [[Keiran]].

Being the youngest, not much attention was placed on her upbringing in context of governance, instead instilling into her the etiquette of royalty and allowing her to grow in her own directions.

Enamored by both magic and bow, Ulyssa spent her time split between both library and shooting range, where she often experimented on using both magic and bow at the same time.

# Cracks
At age 17, Ulyssa experienced several tragedies in a row. Starting from her parent's death in the [[Abandoned Lands]], through her brother's - Keiran's death to Leorick's madness and tyranny, she nearly broke.

Moved by her eldest brother's supporters to [[Wheaton]], Ulyssa had time to think of the current happenings within the kingdom.

After several months, a week after her 18th birthday Ulyssa tried meeting her brother Leorick, only for her to be unable to recognize him in his madness as he proclaimed her an impostor and ordered her death. Luckily escsaping, Ulyssa was hit once again as she understood that there is no saving her brother.
# Call to arms
After her last encounter with her brother, Ulyssa called for support from lords of the kingdom's territory, part of whom answered the call, raising armies and denouncing the Mad Tyrant.

Seeking help from not only inside but also outside, Ulyssa tried to gain help from [[Syzean Empire]], [[Orenian Principality]], [[The Great Wild]] and the dragons said to be living in the [[Dragon Tail]] mountains.
The Empire, splintered in one of it's many civil wars did not give any answer and the Orenian Principality asked for half the land in exchange for help, which Ulyssa deemed unacceptable.
Only The Great Wild answered the call of the princess, though what was paid for this help was never disclosed. As for the dragons, not much is known if they even exist beyond an occasional sighting by a farmer or a miner.

# War
Over the course of 7 years that the war took, Ulyssa grew into a great leader.
Using the regular army, built from her supporters in the kingdom, she organized the frontlines of the war, never too far from the battlefield, in fact often personally participating.

With citizens of Leoric's side serving as moles, she spread cover actions, organizing both supply raids and under the table negotiations with the enemy and neutral lords.

The druids and fey of the Great Wild run both communications, transportations and guerrilla warfare, deep into the enemy territory, stopping the reinforcements from coming at the key moments of battles or striking down enemy commanders.

# After War
After the war, Ulyssa quickly took control of the once broken lands and brought order to the kingdom.
A few months after stabilizing the situation, Ulyssa is said to have visited the Great Wilds and spent a few weeks within, but none know if that is true.

Three years after the reunification of the kingdom, Ulyssa took one of her old comrades from the war as her husband.
