# History
## Begginings
The oldest brother of both [[Leorick]] and [[Ulyssa Corvienne|Ulyssa]]. Born a crown prince of [[Warthan Kingdom]], he was educated in all manners of disciplines useful for a monarch.

Despite the responsibilities that being a crown prince carried, Keiran always found time to spend with his siblings, taking a role of a loving brother and role model.

Excelling at governance and diplomacy, Keiran quickly became a star of the kingdom despite his lack of martial and arcane prowess, with people enchanted with his person and skillful management of the country.

## End
At the age of 26, shortly after receiving news of his parents demise in the [[Abandoned Lands]], Keiran was led to a balcony in the royal castle, where he was pushed down so as to simulate suicide.

## Burial
After his death, Keiran was buried by Leorick in the royal catacombs, under the [[Ironback Mountains]] in the first days of his rule, where he lies to this day.
