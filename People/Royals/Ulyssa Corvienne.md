# History
## Beggings
Ulyssa was born as the only princess of [[Warthan Kingdom]], she was also the youngest of the three siblings, being born 5 years after [[Leorick]] and 7 after [[Keiran]].

Being the youngest, not much attention was placed on her upbringing in context of governance, instead instilling into her the etiquette of royalty and allowing her to grow in her own directions.

Enamored by both magic and bow, Ulyssa spent her time split between both library and shooting range, where she often experimented on using both magic and bow at the same time.

## Cracks
At age 17, Ulyssa experienced several tragedies in a row. Starting from her parent's death in the [[Abandoned Lands]], through her brother's - Keiran's death to Leorick's madness and tyranny, she nearly broke.

Moved by her eldest brother's supporters to [[Wheaton]], Ulyssa had time to think of the current happenings within the kingdom.

After several months, a week after her 18th birthday Ulyssa tried meeting her brother Leorick, only for her to be unable to recognize him in his madness as he proclaimed her an impostor and ordered her death. Luckily escaping, Ulyssa was hit once again as she understood that there is no saving her brother.
