# History
## Beggings
Ulyssa was born as the only princess of [[Warthan Kingdom]], she was also the youngest of the three siblings, being born 5 years after [[Leorick]] and 7 after [[Keiran]] in **4737 AR***.

Being the youngest, not much attention was placed on her upbringing in context of governance, instead instilling into her the etiquette of royalty and allowing her to grow in her own directions.

Enamored by both magic and bow, Ulyssa spent her time split between both library and shooting range, where she often experimented on using both magic and bow at the same time.

## Cracks
At age 17, in **4754 AR*** Ulyssa experienced several tragedies in a row. Starting from her parent's death in the [[Abandoned Lands]], through her brother's - Keiran's death to her other brother's - Leorick's madness and tyranny, she nearly broke.

Moved by her eldest brother's supporters to [[Wheaton]], Ulyssa had time to think of the current happenings within the kingdom.

#TODO Ulyssa herself appeared and tried speaking reason. Sadly, Leorick convinced she was an impostor decreed her execution. Thanks to a previously prepared spell however, Ulyssa managed to escape.
