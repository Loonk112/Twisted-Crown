## Beginnings
Leorick was born a second prince in the [[Warthan Kingdom]], born 2 years after his brother - [[Keiran]] and 5 before his sister [[Ulyssa Corvienne|Ulyssa]].
While his parents could not give him much attention to avoid any potential struggle for the position of the crown prince, the same could not be said for his older brother, whom often spent time with Leorick, becoming an irreplaceable figure in his life. After her birth, Ulyssa also became a light in his life that he followed and protected.

Though his childhood was relatively normal, he always wanted more and never hesitated to use his status to achieve his wants.
Through nobles greedy for power and influence, he gained access to various items and teachers that taught him various things. Notably, among his teachers was a lack of any to teach etiquette, governance, diplomacy and other princely duties.
Born with high intellect and charisma, however the boy quickly caught on to the nobles schemes and started an act when in public setting, portraying a naive, gullible princeling that would always listen to his advisors. In reality however, Leorick used his access to royal library and his brother to learn what the nobles kept from him.

The education that the nobles arranged for him, nurtured him into a powerful warrior, unafraid to use less then honorable ways to win.
At one point, among the items Leorick laid his hands on were those bearing power and knowledge of deceased casters, such as grimoires that he used to grow his magical potency and knowledge in secret from his sponsors.
From his brother's teachings and library books, Leorick became a charismatic man. While still hiding, Leorick used it to encroach upon his sponsors' supporters and convert them into his own, often orchestrating a crisis that he miraculously solved. To those he sook to gain power over he shown his face as an intelligent and charming prince, gaining a large following among his subordinates.

## Rise to power
Through all his qualities, Leorick was an arrogant person, whom believed that once he grasped something, it would never break it's leash. This culminated in a fatal lack of supervision over those of his supporters that he believed to be the most loyal.

This faction was not only the most loyal but also fanatical. When the prince's parents died during an expedition to the [[Abandoned Lands]] when he was 22 in ***4754 AR***, they decided to act quickly and ensure that their liege becomes the next king. 
They orchestrated an assassination of Keiran, pretending his death to be a suicide from grief over his parents the same day the news arrived at the capital. Leorick, having them at loose leash, learned about it too late to stop the plot.

## Coronation
Leorick was crowned 3 months after Keiran's murder, on ***6.4754 AR***

Placed as the crown prince against his wishes, as he never wanted the crown, the first thing Leorick did in his grief was an order to execute all involved in Keiran's death - down to the youngest children.
For unknowing of the assassination, this order was irrational and radical, as such most, including the royal guard refused the order. Some in fact went a step further and hid the targets of the order.
This resulted in several things, two of which are more important then others - Spread of information about the assassination by Leorick's faction and Leorick personally beheading the commander of the royal guard as an example.

Within the chaos resulting from these revelations, the faction of the first prince took the grieving and confused Ulyssa away from the [[Crow's Eye]], bringing her to [[Wheaton]] up north.

Leorick, spiraling into madness, forcibly ensured that his first order be carried out by personally executing any who opposed, along with using those of his supporters that did not participate in the assassination to dispose of their families.

## Rule
Leorick ruled the kingdom with bloodied fist. Having spiraled into madness from the day he came to rule, he was convinced that his sister, Ulyssa was killed by the nobles in an act of revenge for his brother. 

In ***4756 AR***, during one of the king's speeches, Ulyssa herself appeared and tried speaking reason. Sadly, Leorick convinced she was an impostor decreed her execution. Thanks to a previously prepared spell however, Ulyssa managed to escape.

As Leorick ruled, each day growing more and more unhinged and extreme the next two years, discontent grew among nobles and people.

At one point, [[Blackwing Assembly]] was founded in ***4758 AR***.
By **4759 AR***, news of this alliance reached Leorick during annual Grand Meeting, and in rage, he pulled out his sword and personally cut down 3 of present 14 nobles, ordering the rest to be imprisoned ([[Red Council]]).
