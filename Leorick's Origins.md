# Beginnings
[[Leorick]] was born a second prince in the [[Warthan Kingdom]], born 2 years after his brother - [[Keiran]] and 5 before his sister [[Ulyssa]].
While his parents could not give him much attention to avoid any potential struggle for the position of the crown prince, the same could not be said for his older brother, whom often spent time with Leorick, becoming an irreplaceable figure in his life. After her birth, Ulyssa also became a light in his life that he followed and protected.

Though his childhood was relatively normal, he always wanted more and never hesitated to use his status to achieve his wants.
Through nobles greedy for power and influence, he gained access to various items and teachers that taught him various things. Notably, among his teachers was a lack of any to teach etiquette, governance, diplomacy and other princely duties.
Born with high intellect and charisma, however the boy quickly caught on to the nobles schemes and started an act when in public setting, portraying a naive, gullible princeling that would always listen to his advisors. In reality however, Leorick used his access to royal library and his brother to learn what the nobles kept from him.

The education that the nobles arranged for him, nurtured him into a powerful warrior, unafraid to use less then honorable ways to win.
At one point, among the items Leorick laid his hands on were those bearing power and knowledge of deceased casters, such as grimoires that he used to grow his magical potency and knowledge in secret from his sponsors.
From his brother's teachings and library books, Leorick became a charismatic man. While still hiding, Leorick used it to encroach upon his sponsors' supporters and convert them into his own.

# Rise to power
Through all his qualities, Leorick was an arrogant person, whom believed that once he grasped something, it would never break it's leash. This culminated in a fatal lack of supervision over those of his supporters that he believed to be the most loyal.

This faction was not only the most loyal but also fanatical. When the prince's parents died during an expedition to the [[Abandoned Lands]] when he was 24, they decided to act quickly and ensure that their liege becomes the next king. They orchestrated an assassination of Keiran, pretending his death to be a suicide from grief over his parents. Leorick, having them at loose leash, learned about it too late to stop the plot.

Placed as the crown prince against his will, the first thing Leorick did in his grief was an order to execute all involved in Keiran's death - down to the youngest children.
For unknowing of the assassination, this order was irrational and radical, as such most, including the royal guard refused the order. Some in fact went a step further and hid the targets of the order.
This resulted in several things, two of which are more important then others - Spread of information about the assassination by Leorick's faction and Leorick personally beheading the commander of the royal guard.

Within the chaos resulting from these revelations, the faction of the first prince took the grieving and confused Ulyssa away from the [[Crow's Eye|capital]], bringing her to [[Wheaton]] up north.

Leorick, spiraling into madness, forcibly ensured that his first order be carried out by personally executing any who opposed, along with using those of his supporters that did not participate in the assassination to dispose of their families.

# Rule
Leorick ruled the kingdom with bloodied fist. Having spiraled into madness from the day he came to rule, he was convinced that his sister, Ulyssa was killed by the nobles in an act of revenge for his brother. Even when Ulyssa herself came out that she is alive, he declared her impostor and ordered her death.

Leoric ruled this way for 8 years, each day growing more and more unhinged and extreme.
That is not to say that he was without followers as he clearly divided punishment and rewards, gaining fanatical support among some.
# Fall
Leorick's fall happened where it began - in Crow's Eye.
Ulyssa and her allies stood an iron wall in his path of terror, allowing to gather and grow strength to strike the mad tyrant down.
Through countless battles, both successes and defeats, the resistance managed to push up to the walls of the capital, where a select group of three snuck through the sewers into the capital castle and faced Leoric, at that time called The Mad Tyrant.
Through a long and prolonged battle, the three could not manage to kill the tyrant as he was too powerful. In desperation, the three cast a spell to banish him away from this world at the cost of their own lives.
# Escape
Stuck in the prison the now dead heroes sent him, Leorick managed to find a crack leading into the Dark Tapestry

# Return
Today, 500 years after his exile, when he is only remembered as The Mad Tyrant whom was killed by the heroes he returns to the Crow's Eye just in time for festival celebrating his death.
Changed by his time away he is no longer human and he brings madness and destruction with him.
